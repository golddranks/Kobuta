# Kobuta
## Summary

A binary data serialization format for tabular data
that is fast for common use cases,
strongly-typed and (reasonably) simple.
It is meant to be easy and fast to convert from and to
popular text formats such as CSV and JSON and fast to
map/filter/fold over as an in-memory format.
