# 9th Sep 2018 The test round
- Implemented the helper module create_test_data

# 1st Oct 2018 The first round
- Started implementing parse_csv command and the corresponding library functions

# 2nd Oct 2018 The second round
- Parsing CSV to KBT blocks seems to work now!
(But I'm not sure because we don't have tests or round-tripping yet.)
